//! Super TTS consent dialog — a small floating libcosmic window that the
//! daemon spawns when an app asks to authenticate.
//!
//! The daemon spawns this binary with env vars carrying the request details
//! (the names are [`contract`]'s, shared with Super STT):
//!
//! - `SUPER_TTS_AUTH_APP_NAME` — declared (untrusted) app name from the request.
//!   Shown for a native caller, never for a web one — see [`Caller`].
//! - `SUPER_TTS_AUTH_SCOPES`   — space-separated scope set (e.g. `speak status`)
//! - `SUPER_TTS_AUTH_EXE_PATH` — peer `/proc/<pid>/exe` (trusted, kernel-resolved)
//! - `SUPER_TTS_AUTH_FLATPAK_APP_ID` — set only when the caller is inside a flatpak
//! - `SUPER_TTS_AUTH_WEB_ORIGIN` — set only when the caller reached the daemon
//!   over its TCP listener, carrying the browser-reported origin. The daemon
//!   sets this *or* `SUPER_TTS_AUTH_EXE_PATH`, never both, and this one wins.
//!
//! The user clicks Allow or Deny. The dialog writes one of `allow`, `deny`,
//! or `dismissed` to stdout (newline-terminated) and exits.
//!
//! ## Floating-window behavior
//!
//! The dialog is rendered as a Wayland **layer-shell** surface
//! (`Layer::Overlay`, `KeyboardInteractivity::Exclusive`,
//! `anchor: Anchor::empty()`). Tiling compositors (cosmic-comp, sway,
//! Hyprland, niri, etc.) treat layer-shell surfaces as overlays — they
//! are NOT subject to tiling logic — so the consent dialog floats
//! everywhere by construction. This is the same protocol cosmic-osd
//! uses for the polkit-auth dialog and the volume/brightness OSDs.
//!
//! For X11 sessions, layer-shell isn't available; libcosmic falls back
//! to a regular window. On X11 tiling WMs you'd add a per-class float
//! rule using the `WM_CLASS` `super-tts-consent`.
