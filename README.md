## What is Super TTS?

Super TTS makes text-to-speech **trivial on Linux, for everyone**. Send it text and it speaks — from a shell pipeline, a keyboard shortcut, or an app that streams an LLM's reply as it is generated.

Under the hood it's two things:

- **A model-agnostic engine.** A background daemon installs voice models from a **library** of backends (local or cloud), loads one, and keeps it warm so speech starts immediately. You pick the model that fits your hardware and swap it whenever you like.
- **An open protocol.** The daemon speaks a documented HTTP protocol over a local socket, so *any* app, in any language, can make the machine talk, follow playback, or stream live audio visualizations — with per-app consent. Super TTS's own desktop app, CLI, and COSMIC applet are just the first clients. See [Developers](#-developers).

## 🚀 Installation

**Quick install** - detects your system and downloads pre-built binaries:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorge-menjivar/super-tts/main/install.sh | bash
```

Append `-s -- --beta` for the latest beta.

**Build from source** - for the very latest changes (needs the [build prerequisites](./CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorge-menjivar/super-tts.git
cd super-tts
just install
```

Either way you get the daemon, the `tts` CLI, a consent helper, the desktop app, and (on COSMIC) the panel applet, wired up as a `systemctl --user` service. Everything installs system-wide (root-owned, so the installer asks for sudo), while the daemon itself runs unprivileged in your user session. GPU acceleration comes from the model you run (see [Models](#-models)).

## ⌨️ Using it

```bash
tts speak "The kettle is boiling."   # speak some text
echo "Hello there." | tts speak      # …or pipe it in
tts stop                             # fall silent
```

`tts speak` returns as soon as the audio is queued — the daemon keeps talking after the command exits. A second `speak` interrupts the first, which is what "say this instead" means; `tts stop` silences it outright.

Both are worth binding to a key combo, `tts stop` especially.

Manage the daemon with the usual systemd controls:

```bash
systemctl --user start super-tts      # or: enable / status / restart
journalctl --user -u super-tts -f     # follow logs
```

### Per-utterance options

```bash
tts speak --voice af_heart --speed 1.1 "Read this a little faster."
```

| Option           | Effect                                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--voice`        | A voice the loaded model declares. Defaults to the model's own default.  |
| `--language`     | BCP-47 override, for multilingual models.                               |
| `--speed`        | Rate multiplier. Models that can't vary rate ignore it.                 |
| `--instructions` | Free-text delivery guidance, for models that accept it.                 |

### Long text and streaming

Long text is split on sentence boundaries so playback starts before the whole thing is synthesized. Markup that would otherwise be read out literally — emphasis markers, code fences, link targets, table pipes — is stripped first; numbers, dates, and currency are left exactly as written, because every model in scope reads them correctly and a wrong number-to-words is worse than none.

An app generating text can stream it in as it arrives over a WebSocket, and the daemon speaks each sentence as it completes — so an LLM's opening line is heard while it is still writing the third. See [`/speak/stream`](./docs/protocol/endpoints/v1/speak/stream.md).

## 🎙️ Cloned voices

Models that support it can speak in a voice you supply. Open the app's **Voices** page, record a sample or import a WAV, name it, and it joins your library:

```bash
tts speak --voice voice:2f8a2d0e-9c31-4e77-b0aa-1c6b2f0a51d4 "Read this in my voice."
```

A voice is stored once and independently of any model — each model takes as much of the recording as it declares it can use, so switching models never means recording again. Samples live in `~/.local/share/super-tts/voices`, readable only by you, and reach nothing but the loaded model. Apps ask for them under a scope of their own: an app allowed to change every setting still cannot read your recordings unless you approve that separately.

See [`/voices`](./docs/protocol/endpoints/v1/voice.md) for the endpoints, and the [`voices` scope](./docs/protocol/scopes/voices.md) for what granting it means.

## 🤖 Models

Models come from a **library** of backends you install on demand. Open the app, go to **Library → Browse**, install a backend, and it appears in the model selector. Some run **locally** (your text never leaves your machine); others are **online** providers you reach with your own API key, which is stored securely in your system keyring (GNOME Keyring, KWallet, …).

> **The catalog is empty right now.** Super TTS is a new engine and no voice backends have been published to it yet. The engine, the protocol, and the installer all work end to end — there is simply nothing in the library to install until the first backends ship. If you want to be first, anyone can [publish one](./docs/protocol/README.md#add-your-own-model).

> **GPU acceleration** is a property of the model, not a separate build of the app. Install a GPU-capable backend and the daemon downloads the build matched to your GPU automatically. You just need an up-to-date driver.

The app always shows the current catalog, published live at [`jorge-menjivar.github.io/super-tts/index.json`](https://jorge-menjivar.github.io/super-tts/index.json).

## 🖥️ The desktop app

The app is where you manage everything the CLI doesn't ask about. Its pages:

| Page | What it's for |
|------|---------------|
| **Models** | Pick the model to keep loaded, choose CPU or GPU, and set its language. Shows what's warm right now. |
| **Library** | Browse the catalog, install and remove backends, and enter API keys for online providers. |
| **Voices** | Record or import a reference clip and manage your cloned voices. |
| **Speech** | Playback volume and the audio cues the daemon plays. |
| **Customization** | Appearance, and the applet's visualization style. |
| **Connection** | Which apps hold a session token, what they may do, and revoking them. |
| **Updates** | Check for a new release and opt into betas. |

On COSMIC, the panel applet adds a live visualizer driven by whatever is currently
being spoken — **waveform**, **centered equalizer**, **bottom equalizer**, or
**pulse** — plus a working animation while a model is loading. It can sit on
either side of the panel, or span it in full.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

- **`tts: command not found`**: binaries are installed system-wide and are on `PATH` by default — restart your terminal so it rehashes, and check the installer finished without errors.
- **Daemon won't start / misbehaves**: check `journalctl --user -u super-tts -n 50`.
- **`tts speak` succeeds but nothing is heard**: the command returns as soon as the audio is queued, so a silent success means either no model is loaded (`tts status` will say so) or the output device is muted. Check your system volume and the daemon log.
- **Speech is choppy on a remote model**: the daemon starts playing as soon as it has enough audio buffered, so a slow provider can underrun. A local model removes the round trip.

## 🧑‍💻 Developers

Super TTS is built to be built on. The details live in developer-facing docs:

- **Build a client** — make the machine talk, follow playback, or stream text in from your own app, in any language, over the documented HTTP protocol → **[docs/protocol/](./docs/protocol/)**
- **Add your own model** — package a voice model as a backend the daemon can install and run, then publish it to the catalog → **[docs/protocol/](./docs/protocol/)** and **[registry/README.md](./registry/README.md)**
- **Contribute** — build from source, workspace layout, and the PR workflow → **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)**

Architecture and the security model live in **[docs/](./docs/)**.
