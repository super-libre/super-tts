//! The `/v1/voices` cloned-voice library responses.
//!
//! A cloned voice is a reference recording plus the id that names it on
//! `POST /speak`. The daemon serializes these shapes from its on-disk library;
//! the settings UI deserializes them and renders one card per voice. Keeping
//! the shape here, shared by both sides, is what keeps the wire contract from
//! drifting — the same arrangement [`backends`](super::backends) uses.
//!
//! The daemon's stored `voice.json` is deliberately **not** this type. Storage
//! and wire agree today, and separating them costs one small conversion, but
//! the alternative is a file format that cannot change without changing the
//! protocol.
//!
//! `#[serde(default)]` on the non-identity fields lets an older daemon that
//! omits a newer field still deserialize.
