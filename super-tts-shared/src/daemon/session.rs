//! Session-token cache for HTTP-protocol clients.
//!
//! Two layers of caching, in order of priority:
//!
//! 1. **In-memory cache** (this module's `TOKEN_CACHE`). Hot path —
//!    set on the first successful `obtain` and reused for the rest of
//!    the process's lifetime. No keyring access on cache hit, which
//!    matters a lot when a long-lived widget reconnects in a tight
//!    loop while the daemon is down.
//! 2. **System keyring** (libsecret/KWallet). Cold-start persistence
//!    — read once on first `obtain` to recover a token from a previous
//!    process run. Best-effort write whenever a fresh token is minted.
//!
//! Each app gets its own keyring "user" (= [`AppId`] string) so they
//! don't overwrite each other's tokens. The storage value is just the
//! bearer string; scope and expiry live server-side and the daemon
//! returns `invalid_session` if the client presents a stale token.
