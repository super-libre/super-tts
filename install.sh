# Super STT Installation Bootstrap
#
# Documented entry point:
#
#   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorge-menjivar/super-stt/main/install.sh | bash
#   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorge-menjivar/super-stt/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --beta
#
# This script is deliberately tiny: it detects the architecture, resolves
# the requested release, downloads the `super-stt-install` binary attached
# to that release, and execs it. All installer logic lives in that binary
# (rustup-style), so the bootstrap can never disagree with the release
# layout it installs.
#
# Every install goes through that binary, so a release must ship one to be
# installable this way — v0.2.2-beta.3 is the earliest that does. Pinning an
# older tag with --version= is reported as an error rather than installed by
# some other means.
#
# Flags consumed here:
#   --beta / --stable / --channel=<name>   Pick the release channel
#   --version=<tag>                        Pin a release tag
# Everything else is passed through to the installer.
#
# The pure logic below (arch detection, channel validation, tag resolution
# from a JSON string) is factored into functions so `scripts/test-install.sh`
# can source this file and exercise them directly against fixture JSON,
# without making a network call or running a real install. See the guard at
# the bottom of the file for how that source-only mode is triggered.

# order, but not a contract) AND that neither literal string ever appears
# inside a release's `body` text (a changelog that quotes either desyncs
# every later pair). Both hazards are real and NOT closed here — `jq` is
# what actually fixes them (see [`resolve_beta_tag`]'s exact reasoning-over-
# parsed-objects path below); `scripts/test-install.sh` pins the
