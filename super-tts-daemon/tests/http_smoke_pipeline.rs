//! `/pipeline` HTTP smoke test, driving stage 1 (synthesis).
//!
//! Covers the endpoint family's contract against a live daemon:
//! 1. `GET /pipeline` reports the stages in order, and `GET /pipeline/{stage}`
//!    is narrowed from that same report, so the two can never disagree.
//! 2. A position the pipeline does not have is `404 unknown_stage`, on every
//!    path that carries a stage number.
//! 3. `GET /pipeline/1/backend/list` is what `POST /pipeline/1` accepts, and
//!    `GET /pipeline/1/model/list` is what the selected backend serves.
//! 4. Select a backend, run nothing, deselect — a stage's backend and its model
//!    are separate lifetimes with separate verbs.
//! 5. `/pipeline/1/model/{model}/device` reads and records a device **per
//!    model**, with the validation the retired global `/active_device` had no
//!    place to put.
//! 6. `/pipeline/1/device/list` and `.../model/{model}/device/list` say what a
//!    stage's backend, and one of its models, can be run on here.
//!
//! Uses `SUPER_TTS_KEYRING_MOCK=1` (in-memory keyring) and
//! `SUPER_TTS_AUTO_APPROVE=1` (no GUI) — hermetic, part of default CI.
//!
//! The fixture backend declares one local model (`kokoro-82m`, cpu+gpu) and one
//! that runs remotely (`gpt-4o-tts`, `none`), so both sides of every device
//! answer are exercisable. Both are `wasm` with a placeholder entrypoint: these
//! tests drive selection and validation, which happen before anything is
//! loaded, and the required secret keeps the daemon from loading a model at
//! startup.
