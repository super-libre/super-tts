//! so an update discarded gigabytes of weights that immediately re-downloaded.
//! A file is still valid when both manifests offer a `destination` the same
//! `url`s: a destination the new manifest no longer declares is a deleted file,
//! and a changed `url` at the same destination is a changed one.
//!
//! `url`s, plural, because a destination may be declared as several

//! one. Comparing the group whole sidesteps having to know which: if the same
//! variants are on offer, whatever is on disk is still one of them. Nothing
//! here probes the GPU, and an update that changes which variant this machine
//! wants is caught at provision time, where the file is verified anyway.
//!
//! `sha256` is deliberately not part of the predicate. `download::usable_existing`
//! re-verifies every carried file against the new manifest's hash at provision
//! time and re-downloads on mismatch, so a stale hash cannot survive; checking
//! it here would only duplicate that.
