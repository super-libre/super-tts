Installs a backend from the registry, from a git-forge repository, or from a directory \
already staged on this machine — send exactly one of `source`, `repo_url`, or \
`local_path`. A `repo_url` install may also name its `forge`; without one the daemon \
picks the forge serving the URL's host.

The daemon picks the release asset matching this host's architecture and accelerators, \
and answers `202` as soon as that choice is made: the download, verification and \
install run in the background. Follow them on the `registry_install` event topic, keyed \
by the returned `install_id`. A `warning` of `unverified_source` means the bytes came \
from somewhere the registry does not vouch for — a custom repo or a local directory — \
and is worth showing the user.

Installing neither selects the backend nor loads a model; do that through \
`POST /pipeline/{stage}` and `POST /pipeline/{stage}/model`. Upgrading one already \
installed is `POST /registry/backend/update`, which runs this same pipeline.",
