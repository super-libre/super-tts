What the daemon can see of this machine's accelerators: one entry per detected GPU \
with its memory, plus the host-wide driver and runtime versions that decide which \
backend builds will actually run here.

Detection is a live probe, so this reflects the machine now rather than a cached \
answer. A host with no GPU answers `200` with an empty list.

This is the machine, not a model. To find out where one model may actually be \
placed — the intersection of this inventory with the builds that model ships — ask \
