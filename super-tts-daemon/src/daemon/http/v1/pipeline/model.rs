picking it a second time. `loaded` is what says whether it is up, and what `POST \
/speak` requires. `switch` can be present while `model` is still `null`; that is a \
stage's very first load.

`device` carries the stored preference and what it resolved to, which is all a picker \
needs to render its current value. What the model *could* run on is \
`GET /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/device/list`, kept separate because that answer \

against the stage's selection rather than by scanning for whoever serves the name.

A load that fails leaves the backend selected and *no* model loaded. The daemon does \
not quietly restore whatever was running before, because a client that asked for a \
switch and was told it succeeded would then be speaking in the old voice.
