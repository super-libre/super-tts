A reload that fails puts the model back on the device it had, leaves the setting as it \

did not happen. Asking for the device a loaded model is already on reloads nothing, \

the preference and the resolved accelerator separately is for.

Asking for `gpu` on a host that cannot provide one is not an error: the load falls \
back to the CPU and says so in `resolved_accel`, because slower speech is better than \
no speech. A client that wants to offer only what will work narrows its picker to \
