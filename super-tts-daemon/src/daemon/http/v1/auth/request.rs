The consent handshake, and the only endpoint reachable without a token.

The daemon reads `SO_PEERCRED` on your connection, resolves `/proc/<pid>/exe`, and \
shows the user a popup naming that binary and the scopes you asked for. On Allow it \
mints a 32-byte token bound to that binary and valid for 30 days.

A denial is remembered for the `(binary, scopes)` pair for the rest of the daemon's \
lifetime and answers `403` immediately without re-prompting — renaming your app does \
not clear it, since the key is the binary. Restarting the daemon does.

Do not call this to find out whether a token you already hold is still good: that is \
`GET /auth/status`, which never prompts.

Setting `SUPER_TTS_AUTO_APPROVE=1` in the daemon's environment skips the popup \
entirely; it is honored only in debug builds, for tests and CI, so a stray \
environment variable cannot defeat the consent gate in a shipped binary.",
