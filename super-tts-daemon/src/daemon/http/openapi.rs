HTTP/1.1 + JSON on two transports that serve the identical API.

**A Unix domain socket** at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tts/super-tts-http.sock` (override with \
`SUPER_TTS_HTTP_SOCKET`), which is what native clients use. Its filesystem permissions \
are the first layer of access control, and the daemon reads `SO_PEERCRED` on each \
connection to identify the calling binary. It is the second server below, listed by its \
real path — dial that path directly and send whatever `Host` you like, since the daemon \
ignores it.

**A loopback TCP listener**, which is what a browser can reach, since no browser can dial \
a Unix socket. It is the first server below, and it is a real address. There are no peer \
credentials on TCP, so a caller there is identified by its `Origin` instead — a claim from \
the browser rather than a fact from the kernel, which is why the consent dialog says so.

Every endpoint except `POST /v1/auth/request` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. \
A token is minted only after the user approves your client in a consent dialog, and is \
bound to whichever identity was approved — a binary or an origin, never interchangeable. \
A client cannot widen its own permissions. See `docs/protocol/auth.md`.

With curl, over the socket:

```
curl --unix-socket \"$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tts/super-tts-http.sock\" \\
     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TTS_TOKEN\" \\
     http://tts.local/v1/ping
