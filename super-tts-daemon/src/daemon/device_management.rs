//! The device a model runs on, and the global default behind it.
//!
//! A device is a property of a model, not of the daemon: a small voice runs
//! fine on the CPU while the large one beside it needs the GPU, and a single
//! global switch forced a user who wanted the GPU for one of them to accept it
//! for both. So the preference is stored per `(source, model)`
//! ([`crate::config::ModelSettings::device`]), and the global
//! `device.preferred_device` survives as the fallback a model with no choice
//! of its own inherits — which is also what keeps a config written before
//! per-model devices loading its models exactly where it always did.
//!
//! Which handler a request lands in decides what setting a device *means*: for
//! the model that is currently loaded it is a reload onto the new device, for
//! any other model it is a note its next load picks up. Both answer with the
//! same `{ device, resolved_accel, available_devices }` body so a client never
//! has to know which case it hit.
