//! The speak path: text in, audio out of the speakers.
//!
//! Sits between the `/speak` endpoint and the two halves already built — the
//! backend's `POST /v1/synthesize` ([`crate::tts_models::v1`]) and the playback
//! pipeline ([`crate::audio::playback`]) — and owns the small amount of state
//! that belongs to neither: which utterance is current, and how to stop it.
//!
//! **A channel bridges the sink and the ring.** [`SynthesisSink::on_frame`] is
//! synchronous (it is called from inside the frame decoder), while
//! [`Playback::push`] is async because it waits for ring space. So the sink
//! decodes samples and hands them to a pump task over a channel, and the pump
//! does the awaiting. This is what makes playback start while the backend is
//! still producing, rather than after it finishes.
//!
//! **The audio device is opened lazily, on a dedicated thread.** cpal's stream
//! is `!Send` on several backends, so it cannot live in the daemon's shared
//! state alongside everything the async tasks touch. The thread opens the
//! device, sends the [`Playback`] producer half back, and parks holding the
//! stream. Opening lazily rather than at startup keeps a daemon that never
//! speaks from claiming an output device it will not use.
//!
//! **One utterance at a time, newest wins.** A second `/speak` cancels the
//! first rather than queueing behind it. That is the v1 policy, not the end
//! state: every utterance already carries an id, so a real queue with priority
//! and ducking can be added without changing the endpoint's shape.
