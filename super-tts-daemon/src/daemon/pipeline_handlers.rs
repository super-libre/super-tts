//! `GET /pipeline` — the ordered stages an utterance passes through.
//!
//! Super TTS has exactly one: stage 1 turns text into audio. It is still
//! addressed by position, and reported as a one-element list rather than a bare
//! object, so a stage put ahead of it — a text normalizer, an LLM rewriter —
//! becomes a second row in a list clients already walk instead of a second
//! endpoint family they have to learn about before they can use it.
//!
//! A stage and its model are reported separately, and that split is what makes
//! the positions interchangeable. A stage is a *backend selection*: durable,
//! surviving an unload and a restart, and unable to fail for runtime reasons.
//! Its model slot is a selection too, but one that also has a runtime — loaded
//! or not, on some device, possibly still downloading. Folding them into one
//! report is what lets a client read "a backend is chosen" as "speech will
//! work" and paint a ready UI over a daemon whose next `speak` will fail.
//!
//! This module only *reports*. The stage is filled through the same
//! `set_active_backend` / `set_model` handlers it always was, so there is one
//! implementation of "select a backend for synthesis", not two that can come to
//! disagree about what counts as selected.
