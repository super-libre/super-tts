//! Streaming speech playback: synthesis chunks in, a continuous audio stream
//! out.
//!
//! The daemon's existing output path ([`crate::audio::beeper`]) plays a
//! fully-precomputed, known-length buffer — "these exact 200 ms of sine wave".
//! Speech is the opposite: chunks arrive over time, at a rate that is not the
//! device's, from separate synthesis requests, and must not gap between them or
//! keep sounding once the user interrupts.
//!
//! Three pieces, split by which thread they run on:
//!
//! - [`mixer`] prepares a chunk — resample, channel-map, fade the seam.
//!   Producer side, pure, allocates freely.
//! - [`ring`] is the handoff: a preallocated buffer both sides memcpy through.
//! - [`Playback`] owns the state machine and the cpal stream. The audio
//!   callback only ever locks briefly and memcpys.
//!
//! Everything except the cpal binding is exercised through [`Playback::render`]
//! — the same entry point the callback uses — so the pipeline is testable
//! against a null sink with no audio device present.
//!
//! **Realtime discipline.** The crate builds with `panic = "abort"`, so a panic
//! on the audio callback thread takes the daemon down mid-utterance instead of
//! glitching. The callback path therefore has no indexing that can go out of
//! bounds, no unwrap, no allocation, and never blocks: it takes the state lock
//! with `try_lock` and renders silence if it cannot get it.
