//! Turning a backend's synthesis chunk into samples the output device can take.
//!
//! Three transformations, in order: resample to the device rate, map channels,
//! and fade each end of the chunk. All of it is pure and runs on the producer
//! side — the audio callback only ever memcpys out of the ring.
//!
//! The seam is the part that earns its keep. Consecutive chunks come from
//! *separate* synthesis requests (sentence 1, then sentence 2), so nothing makes
//! the last sample of one continuous with the first of the next. Butting them
//! together steps the waveform discontinuously, and that step is audible as a
//! click on every sentence boundary. [`SeamFade`] takes each chunk to zero at
//! both ends so the boundary is continuous by construction — see its docs for
//! why that rather than an overlap-add crossfade.
