//! Splitting normalized text into synthesis chunks.
//!
//! # Why chunk at all
//!
//! Two reasons, and they pull in opposite directions.
//!
//! A model may declare `max_input_chars`, and text over it is simply refused —
//! most local models have a hard input length. That is a correctness bound.
//!
//! The other reason is latency: nothing is heard until the first chunk comes
//! back, so a short first chunk gets speech started while the rest is still
//! synthesizing. But every extra split costs a round trip and resets the
//! model's prosodic context, which is audible as a flatter reading. So the
//! policy here is deliberately asymmetric — one small chunk to kill dead air,
//! then as few splits as the model's limit allows.
//!
//! # Sentence boundaries
//!
//! Splitting mid-sentence sounds wrong in a way splitting between sentences
//! does not, so the chunker only ever cuts at a boundary — except when a single
//! "sentence" exceeds the model's limit, where it falls back to a word break
//! rather than refusing to speak.
//!
//! Finding those boundaries is most of the work, and getting it wrong is
//! audible: "Dr. Smith arrived" split after `Dr.` produces two utterances with
//! a pause and a dropped intonation. See `boundary_end`.
//!
//! # Streaming and one-shot must agree
//!
//! The daemon's one-shot path is the streaming one with the whole string
//! pushed at once, so the same text must chunk the same way however it is cut
//! into deltas — otherwise `POST /speak` and `GET /speak/stream` read the same
//! sentence with different phrasing, and which one you get depends on the
//! producer's token sizes.
//!
//! That does not come for free. A terminator is judged by what *follows* it,
//! so a delta ending just after one leaves the question open, and answering it
//! early — in either direction — breaks the invariant. Hence the chunker's
//! boundary verdict has three states rather than two: "not a boundary" means
//! look further back, "cannot tell yet" means wait for the next delta.
