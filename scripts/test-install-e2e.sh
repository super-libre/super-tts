#!/bin/bash
# End-to-end install verification: performs a REAL install of a REAL
# published release onto THIS machine, asserts the complete installed tree,
# then runs uninstall.sh and asserts nothing is left behind.
#
# This is the counterpart to scripts/test-install.sh, which only covers
# install.sh's pure, network-free logic (arch detection, channel validation,
# tag resolution from fixture JSON). Nothing there — and nothing in
# super-stt-install's own `--dry-run` e2e test — ever writes a file, escalates,
# or runs post-install. That is what this script covers.
#
# Two passes run per channel, each install → assert → uninstall → assert-clean:
#
#   1. Bootstrap pass. `install.sh --<channel>`, the documented `curl | bash`
#      path: it resolves the release, downloads the installer asset published
#      with it, and execs that. This is the released installer, so the pass
#      verifies the bootstrap's own resolution and asset naming against a real
#      release.
#   2. Local pass. The same install driven by a locally built
#      `super-stt-install` ($SUPER_STT_INSTALLER_BIN), so changes to the
#      installer crate in a PR are what is under test rather than whatever the
#      last release shipped.
#
# The fixture is deliberately the *published* tarball rather than one built
# here: it makes the job cheap (only the installer binary compiles — no GUI
# crates) and it tests exactly the path real users and the in-app updater take.
# The trade-off is that a change to the dist layout (a new resource in
# release.yml that stage::build_manifest starts requiring) fails this test
# until that release actually ships.
#
# Usage: SUPER_STT_INSTALL_E2E_YES=1 bash scripts/test-install-e2e.sh [stable|beta]
#        (or `just test-install-e2e beta`)
