//! sub-resources worth separating ([`backends`], [`pipeline`], [`registry`],
//! [`settings`]); a file otherwise, holding that path and any sub-path small
//! enough to read beside it. [`macros`] is the one module not named for a path,
//! because it is not an endpoint.

//! Not every daemon path is wrapped — only what the settings app calls.
