//! Contract: every path this client calls is one the daemon serves.

//! The client and the daemon are separate crates that never share a type for
//! the thing they most need to agree on — the URL. Each request is a string
//! built here and parsed there, and a mismatch is invisible until runtime,
//! where it surfaces as a `404` inside a settings page that simply renders
//! empty. Nothing in either crate's type system notices; nothing in either
//! crate's test suite did, either, before this.
//!
//! So the paths are read back out of the source and checked against the
//! published `openapi.json` — the same document a third-party client would
//! generate from. Renaming a daemon endpoint and forgetting a call site here
//! now fails the build rather than shipping.
//!
//! Reading source rather than a registry of constants is deliberate: a registry
//! is only honest while every call site uses it, and the first `format!` that
//! skips it is exactly the one that would drift. The literal in the argument is
//! what actually goes on the wire.
