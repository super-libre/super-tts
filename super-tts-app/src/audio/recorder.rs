//! Microphone capture for a cloned-voice reference clip.
//!
//! **The stream lives on its own thread.** cpal's `Stream` is `!Send` on
//! several backends, so it cannot sit in the app model beside everything the
//! UI touches. The thread opens the device, captures until it is told to stop
//! (or until the cap is reached), and drops the stream on its way out; the UI
//! sees only an `Arc<Mutex<…>>` of samples and a peak level.
//!
//! **Opening the device never blocks the UI.** `start` returns immediately and
//! the thread reports failure through the same shared state the level meter
//! reads, so a missing microphone surfaces on the next tick as a message on
//! the page rather than as a frozen window.
//!
//! Capture is mono at whatever rate the device offers. The daemon does the
//! downmix-and-resample to its canonical shape, so there is nothing to match
//! here — sending the device's own rate is the one conversion that cannot be
//! wrong.
