# settings scope

> Scope: **settings** (full read/write access to daemon configuration and the
> backend registry).

The `settings` scope is the configuration surface: a `settings` token can read
every daemon configuration value, change any of them, persist the change to disk,
and manage installed backends through the registry. It covers a backend's
non-sensitive **options**; a backend's **secrets** (API keys) are managed
separately under the [`secrets`](./secrets.md) scope and are never readable.

It grants **only** that surface — scopes no longer imply one another. A Settings
UI that also drives test speech, shows daemon status, or renders a visualizer
requests those scopes *alongside* `settings` in the same handshake, e.g.
`["settings", "status", "speak", "playback_events", "audio_visualization", "daemon_status"]`.
See [auth.md](../auth.md) for how scopes compose, and the individual scope docs
([status](./status.md), [speak](./speak.md),
[playback_events](./playback_events.md),
[audio_visualization](./audio_visualization.md),
[daemon_status](./daemon_status.md)) for what each adds.

Transport and framing are described in [transport.md](../transport.md).

## What gets mirrored on `/events`

Settings mutations have **two** observable wire effects: the HTTP response on the
request that made them, and (for model/device transitions) follow-up SSE events
on any `GET /events` subscription that holds the [`daemon_status`](./daemon_status.md)
scope and asked for `daemon_status_changed` or `download_progress`.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/pipeline/{stage}/model`, `/pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/device` (when it reloads the model), `/settings/allow_online_models` (when it triggers a fallback) | Yes — `daemon_status_changed` (and `download_progress` while files are being pulled)                  |
| `/pipeline/{stage}` (backend selection)                                                                                          | Yes — `daemon_status_changed` (`active_backend_changed` variant)                                      |
| `/settings/language`, `/settings/update_check_enabled`, `/settings/update_beta_optin`                                            | Yes — `daemon_status_changed` (`settings_changed` variant, carrying which setting changed)             |
| `/settings/audio_theme`, `/settings/volume`, `/settings/notification_method`, `/settings/allow_online_models` (no fallback), `/settings/custom_models_dir` | No. Clients that want to see *another* app change one of these must re-`GET` the relevant endpoint.  |

`{backend_id}` is the backend's repository `source`, percent-encoded. `{stage}`
is a pipeline position: `1` is synthesis, and any other position answers
`404 unknown_stage` naming the ones that exist.

Everything a user can *set* is under `/settings/`, and nothing else is.
Sharing the `settings` scope is not the same as being a setting: `/pipeline`,
`/backend`, `/registry`, `/gpu_info` and `/update` need a `settings` token but
select and manage what runs rather than storing a preference, so they sit
outside that namespace.

## A typical settings session

A settings UI usually opens two HTTP connections in parallel: one-shot
connections for each read or write, plus a long-lived SSE connection for
`/events`. The SSE channel carries running model-switch progress so the UI's
progress bar updates without polling — which is why the handshake also requests
[`daemon_status`](./daemon_status.md).

    Note over App,D: 4. User picks a different model

    D-->>App: 202 { message: "Model switch started" }

    Note over App,D: 5. Switch progress arrives on the SSE stream
    D-->>App: event: daemon_status_changed<br/>data: { status: "loading_model", new_model, timestamp }
    loop while files download
        D-->>App: event: download_progress<br/>data: { model_name, percentage, eta_seconds, … }
    end
    D-->>App: event: daemon_status_changed<br/>data: { status: "ready", model_loaded: true, model_name }
```

Settings mutations that aren't mirrored on `/events` (the non-model row of the
table at the top) won't trigger SSE events; a settings UI that wants to detect
another app changing those needs to re-`GET` the relevant endpoint.
