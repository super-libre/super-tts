# Backend Configuration

Every backend ships a `backend.toml` at the root of its directory. The
configuration is the backend's declaration of identity: which models it provides,
which servers it connects to, which files those models need, and which
secrets it requires. The daemon reads it to **discover** a backend without
starting it — discovery is a filesystem scan, so installing a backend costs
nothing until a model it provides is selected.

This document is part of the [backend protocol](./contract.md); see also
[wasm.md](./wasm.md) and [subprocess.md](./subprocess.md) for how the
configuration's fields are honored per transport.

A JSON Schema for this file is generated from the canonical manifest types in
`super-stt-registry-types` and published to GitHub Pages by CI (it is not
committed to the repo). Backends in other repositories reference it at
`https://jorge-menjivar.github.io/super-stt/backend.schema.json`.
Add that URL as a `#:schema` comment line at the top of a `backend.toml` to get
autocomplete and validation in taplo-based editors. Generate it locally with
`just gen-schemas`, which writes to a gitignored `target/schemas/`.

## Discovery

A backend is a directory whose root contains `backend.toml`. The daemon scans
its configured backend search paths and treats every such directory as a
backend. Representative layout:

```text
<backend-dir>/
├── backend.toml            # this configuration
├── whisper-backend         # entrypoint (subprocess binary) …
│                           # … or whisper.wasm (WASM component)
└── models/                 # populated by the daemon at load time
    └── whisper-tiny/
        ├── config.json
        ├── tokenizer.json
        └── model.safetensors
```

The daemon never writes outside a backend's own directory, and a backend
reads only from it. Files a model needs are downloaded by the daemon into
the `dest` paths declared in the configuration (see
[`[[models.files]]`](#modelsfiles)).

## `[backend]`

Backend identity and packaging.

```toml
[backend]
source      = "github.com/super-stt/whisper"
name        = "Whisper (local)"
version     = "0.1.0"
kind        = "subprocess"
entrypoint  = "whisper-backend"
contract    = "v1"
license     = "Apache-2.0"
description = "Local Whisper speech-to-text."
```

| Field        | Type   | Required        | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------|--------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | string | for publication | Globally unique reverse-DNS identifier for the backend, e.g. `app.super-stt.voxtral`. Names the directory the backend is installed into. Required for a backend to be listed in the registry. |
| `source`     | string | yes             | Canonical repository id for this backend. Becomes the `source` of every model it provides (see [identity](./contract.md#model-identity)). Must be unique across installed backends. |
| `name`       | string | yes             | Human-readable display name.                                          |
| `version`    | string | yes             | Backend version (semver).                                            |
| `kind`       | string | yes             | `subprocess` or `wasm` — selects the transport.                       |
| `entrypoint` | string | yes             | Path, relative to the backend directory, to the executable (`subprocess`) or the `.wasm` component (`wasm`). |
| `contract`   | string | yes             | The contract version the backend implements. Must be `v1`; unknown versions are rejected. |
| `license`    | string | for publication | SPDX identifier of a current OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre license (e.g. `Apache-2.0`, `MIT`, `GPL-3.0-only`), or the literal `other` for a license outside that set. Required for registry publication; optional for locally installed backends. |
| `description`| string | yes             | One-line, human-readable summary shown in the registry/Browse listing. |

`license` is checked against the SPDX license list embedded in the registry
indexer — no network access — and must be a single, current (non-deprecated)
SPDX identifier that the list marks OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre, or the
literal `other`. License *expressions* (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`) are not accepted;
declare a single identifier or `other`. A backend declaring `other` is still
published — the app surfaces its license as "Other" — so the value is a
conscious declaration, not an omission.

#### `id` format

- Lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `-`, and `.` only.
- At least three `.`-separated segments.
- Each segment is non-empty, begins with a letter, and does not end with `-`.
- No leading, trailing, or consecutive dots.
- At most 255 bytes.

The reverse-DNS form namespaces a backend under a domain its author
controls, so two unrelated authors may both publish a backend named
`voxtral`: `app.super-stt.voxtral` and `com.example.voxtral` coexist.

`id` names the install directory. It is not part of model identity, which is
the `(name, source)` pair described in [contract.md](./contract.md).

## `[network]`

Outbound network the backend is permitted to reach.

```toml
[network]
allowed_hosts = ["api.openai.com"]
```

| Field           | Type             | Required | Notes                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allowed_hosts` | array of string  | no       | Host or `host:port` egress allowlist. Empty or absent ⇒ no network beyond a user-set [`base_url`](#base_url-and-egress). |

`allowed_hosts` is honored for `wasm` backends, where the daemon enforces it
on every outbound request (see [wasm.md](./wasm.md#network-egress)).
`subprocess` backends run with no network regardless; the field must be
empty for them.

## `[[secrets]]`

Encrypted credentials the backend needs at runtime, such as API keys. A
backend may declare several — a primary and a fallback key, or keys for
different upstreams — and use whichever it needs. The user supplies each
value through the settings UI; the daemon stores it encrypted in the system
keyring and never writes it to disk in plaintext.

```toml
[[secrets]]
name        = "openai_api_key"
label       = "OpenAI API key"
description = "Used to authenticate requests to api.openai.com."

[[secrets]]
name        = "azure_openai_key"
label       = "Azure OpenAI key"
description = "Used only when an Azure deployment is set."
required    = false
```

| Field         | Type   | Required | Notes                                                       |
|---------------|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | string | yes      | snake_case identifier the backend reads the value by. `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`, unique within the table. |
| `label`       | string | no       | Human-readable label shown in the settings UI. Falls back to `name` when absent. |
| `description` | string | yes      | Help text shown beside the input in the settings UI.        |
| `required`    | bool   | no       | Whether a value must be set before the backend can load. Default `false`. |

## `[[options]]`

Non-secret configuration the user can set through the settings UI — a
base-URL override, a timeout, and so on. Options are declared like secrets
and shown beside them, but the daemon stores their values as plaintext
configuration rather than encrypting them.

```toml
[[options]]
name        = "base_url"
label       = "API base URL"
description = "Override the API base URL, e.g. for a gateway."
type        = "string"

[[options]]
name        = "request_timeout_seconds"
label       = "Request timeout"
description = "Per-request timeout in seconds."
type        = "integer"
default     = 30
```

| Field         | Type           | Required | Notes                                                  |
|---------------|----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | string         | yes      | snake_case identifier the backend reads the value by. `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`, unique within the table. |
| `label`       | string         | no       | Human-readable label shown in the settings UI. Falls back to `name` when absent. |
| `description` | string         | yes      | Help text shown beside the input in the settings UI.   |
| `type`        | string         | no       | `string`, `integer`, or `bool`. Drives the input the UI renders. Default `string`. |
| `default`     | matches `type` | no       | Value used when the user sets none. Forbidden on `base_url` — see below. |
| `required`    | bool           | no       | Whether a value must be set before the backend can load. Default `false`. |

#### `base_url` and egress

An option named `base_url` is the convention for a backend's configurable
endpoint. When the user sets one, the daemon treats its authority as
**user-authorized egress** for the backend: it is added to the WASM transport's
egress set at model-load time, and the SSRF resolver guard is relaxed for it
(see [wasm.md — Network egress](./wasm.md#network-egress)). This lets a cloud
backend be pointed at an arbitrary gateway — public, local, or on a private
network — without re-installing the backend.

The name is load-bearing: the daemon recognizes `base_url` and nothing else. An
option called `endpoint`, `api_base`, or `server_url` is a perfectly valid
option, but its value authorizes no egress, so a backend that reads one instead
will have every request refused with `outbound host not allowed` once the user
points it somewhere the manifest's `allowed_hosts` does not cover.

`base_url` is the one option a manifest may declare but not supply a value for.
The reason is the paragraph below — the value authorizes egress the sandbox
would otherwise refuse, and a value the backend author wrote is not user intent.
Every other option keeps its default.

A manifest that declares one is refused **at publication**: the registry indexer
rejects the release, so it never reaches a user. A backend installed some other
way still loads, with the option intact and the declared value dropped and
logged — an author's mistake costs the user a setting, not the backend. Either
way the value never takes effect, so a backend that needs a working endpoint out
of the box carries it in the component and treats the option as an override.
That is what the missing `x-stt-option-base_url` header means when the user has
set nothing.

The value the backend receives is **canonical**. The daemon parses it and
re-serializes it as
`scheme://host[:port][/path]`: the scheme is lowercased, and supplied when
absent; userinfo is stripped; a trailing slash is removed; any query or
fragment is dropped. A port appears only when the user gave one — the daemon
does not add the scheme's default, which would otherwise travel to the upstream
in the `Host` header. The path is preserved exactly as written: it plays no part
in egress, and only the backend knows which path its own API serves.

Normalizing in the daemon rather than in each backend keeps every backend
working from the same value the daemon authorized, and spares each one its own
URL parser.

The same rewrite is applied when the value is **set**, so what
[`POST /backends/{source}/options/{name}`](../endpoints/v1/backends/options.md)
stores is already canonical and the settings field reads back the endpoint that
will be dialed. The scheme is why this is worth doing at the write boundary
rather than only at load: whether a request is encrypted should not be
invisible in the field the user is looking at. A value that yields no host is
the exception — it is stored as typed, so the load-time refusal can name it,
rather than being dropped.

#### The scheme a value without one is read as

A value carrying no scheme is read as `http` when its host is an address the
daemon can see is local — a loopback or private-range IP literal, or the name
`localhost` — and as `https` otherwise. A local endpoint is nearly always a
plaintext one, and reading it as `https` fails every time; a public endpoint is
the opposite. The choice is logged.

Only a value that names no scheme is decided this way, and it is decided before
anything connects. A value that says `https` stays `https` however it fails. The
daemon never retries a failed TLS connection over plaintext: that would let
anyone able to break the handshake move the user's audio and credentials into
the clear, and it would look like success.

A host the daemon cannot classify without resolving it — any name other than
`localhost` — is read as `https`. Guessing `https` for a plaintext endpoint
costs a failed connection, which is loud and recoverable. Guessing `http` for a
TLS one discloses whatever the request carries. Where the two are not equally
wrong, the daemon takes the loud failure.

A value the daemon cannot read as a URL fails the model load, with a message
naming the option. It is not quietly dropped: falling back to the backend's
built-in endpoint would send the user's audio and credentials to the very vendor
they had configured their way out of.

The daemon derives exactly one `host:port` authority from the configured value.
An explicit port is taken as written; otherwise the scheme's default applies —
`http` and `ws` ⇒ 80, `https` and `wss` ⇒ 443 — over the scheme the value names
or the one it is [read as](#the-scheme-a-value-without-one-is-read-as), so the
port the daemon authorizes is the one the backend dials. Any path, query, or
userinfo in the value plays no part in
this derivation, and a value that yields no host contributes nothing: the
backend keeps whatever egress its manifest declares.

The host is authorized on its own as well, so a gateway stays reachable on its
other ports — but only the derived `host:port` carries the relaxation below.
Another port on the same host is therefore reachable while it is public, and
refused once it is local or private.

Relaxing the guard is safe because the value is **the user's only**: the daemon
reads it from config set through the settings-scoped API, never from the
component and never from the manifest, so a backend cannot self-authorize a
metadata endpoint or localhost target. The relaxation lifts the loopback and
private-range blocks — reaching a gateway on `127.0.0.1` or `10.0.0.0/8` is the
point of the option — and nothing further. Link-local addresses
(`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`), including the cloud metadata endpoint
`169.254.169.254`, along with the unspecified and broadcast addresses, stay
refused for every backend however they were authorized. Manifest-declared
`[network].allowed_hosts` entries remain fully SSRF-guarded.

Both secrets and options reach the backend the same way — injected request
headers on every `/v1` request — and differ only in how the daemon stores
them at rest. See [request headers](./contract.md#request-headers).

## `[assets]`

Declares the binary artifacts a release publishes, so the registry indexer and
the daemon's installer can find them without guessing. The shape depends on the
backend's `kind`.

`[assets]` is required for registry publication (the indexer rejects a release
without the table matching the backend's `kind`) and optional for backends
installed locally — an imported directory has no release artifacts to declare.

Wasm backends declare a single file:

```toml
[assets]
wasm = "openai.wasm"   # filename on the release; must be a `wasm32` component
```

Subprocess backends declare one entry per built variant. Selection axes are
`target`, `accel`, and — gated on which accelerator(s) `accel` names —
`cuda_major`/`cuda_sm`/`cudnn` (`cuda`), `gfx` (`rocm`), and `vulkan_api`
(`vulkan`). Each variant names its archive with `file`, or with `parts` when
the `.tar.gz` exceeds the 2 GiB release-asset limit (see [Multi-part assets](#multi-part-assets)).

```toml
[[assets.subprocess]]
file   = "voxtral-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cpu.tar.gz"
target = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
accel  = "cpu"

[[assets.subprocess]]
file       = "voxtral-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda12-sm75.tar.gz"
target     = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
accel      = "cuda"
cuda_major = 12
cuda_sm    = 75

[[assets.subprocess]]
file       = "voxtral-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda12-cudnn-sm75.tar.gz"
target     = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
accel      = "cuda"
cuda_major = 12
cuda_sm    = 75
cudnn      = true

[[assets.subprocess]]
file   = "voxtral-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-rocm.tar.gz"
target = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
accel  = "rocm"
gfx    = ["gfx1030", "gfx1100", "gfx1101"]

[[assets.subprocess]]
file       = "voxtral-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-vulkan.tar.gz"
target     = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
accel      = "vulkan"
vulkan_api = "1.3"

# A build carrying more than one runtime — `accel` as an array — matches
# either. Host matching then considers every accelerator listed.
[[assets.subprocess]]
file       = "voxtral-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda-rocm.tar.gz"
target     = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
accel      = ["cuda", "rocm"]
cuda_major = 12
cuda_sm    = 75
gfx        = ["gfx1030", "gfx1100"]
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | string | one of `file`/`parts` | Filename on the GitHub release. Subprocess: `.tar.gz`; wasm: `.wasm`. |
| `parts` | array of strings | one of `file`/`parts` | **Subprocess only.** Ordered release filenames whose byte-for-byte concatenation is the variant's `.tar.gz`. Use instead of `file` when the archive would exceed the 2 GiB release-asset limit. See [Multi-part assets](#multi-part-assets). |
| `target` | string | yes | Rust target triple. Tier-1/2 only; indexer rejects unknown. |
| `accel` | string or array of strings | yes | A single value, or a non-empty array, drawn from `"cpu"`, `"cuda"`, `"rocm"`, `"metal"`, `"vulkan"`. An array declares one build carrying more than one runtime (e.g. a llama.cpp binary built with both CUDA and HIP support); the build then matches a host that satisfies any of the accelerators listed. |
| `gfx` | array of strings | for `accel` containing `rocm`; forbidden otherwise | AMD architecture targets in `--offload-arch` spelling (`"gfx1030"`, `"gfx90a"`). There is deliberately no wildcard: HIP code objects are architecture-specific AMDGCN ISA with no JIT path, so a build that does not list the host's target cannot run on it. A fat build lists every target it carries. |
| `vulkan_api` | string | no; allowed only when `accel` contains `vulkan` | Minimum Vulkan API version this build requires, as `"major.minor"` (e.g. `"1.3"`). |
| `cuda_major` | integer | for `accel` containing `cuda` | CUDA major version this build targets. |
| `cuda_sm` | integer | no | Compute capability (e.g. `75`, `86`, `90`). Omit to match **any** compute capability — use this for framework builds (e.g. a PyTorch wheel) whose kernels are multi-architecture. When both an exact-SM and a wildcard asset match a host, the exact-SM asset is preferred. Allowed only when `accel` contains `cuda`. |
| `cudnn` | bool | no | Defaults `false`. Allowed only when `accel` contains `cuda`. |

A variant gives `file` **or** `parts`, never both (and `wasm` always uses a
single `file`).

### Multi-part assets

A single GitHub release asset may not exceed **2 GiB**. A build whose `.tar.gz`
is larger — typically a CUDA framework bundle (PyTorch ships ~2.5 GiB of CUDA
libraries) — is split into ordered parts, each a separate release asset under
the limit, and listed in `parts` instead of `file`:

```toml
[[assets.subprocess]]
parts      = [
    "qwen3-asr-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda13.tar.gz.part00",
    "qwen3-asr-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda13.tar.gz.part01",
]
target     = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
accel      = "cuda"
cuda_major = 13
```

The parts' **byte-for-byte concatenation, in the order listed**, reconstitutes
the original `.tar.gz`. The daemon downloads each part, verifies it, concatenates
them in order, then extracts the result. The registry indexer pins every part
independently (`{url, size, sha256}`), so every delivered byte is hash-verified —
there is no separate whole-archive digest. Splitting is purely a delivery
detail: the reassembled archive obeys the same archive-contents rules below, and
host selection (`target`/`accel`/`cuda_*`) is unaffected.

### Subprocess archive contents

A subprocess `.tar.gz` (the reassembled archive, when delivered as
[parts](#multi-part-assets)) MUST contain `bin/<entrypoint>` (the path that the
backend's `[backend].entrypoint` resolves to after extraction). Tarballs
containing path-traversal entries (`..`, absolute paths) or symlinks that
escape the archive root are rejected by the registry indexer and by the
daemon's installer.

## `[capabilities]`

Optional feature flags that unlock transport extensions beyond the base `/v1`
contract. All fields default to `false` and may be omitted entirely.

```toml
[capabilities]
websocket = true
```

| Field       | Type | Required | Notes                                                                              |
|-------------|------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `websocket` | bool | no       | Opt into the `super-stt:realtime/ws` import and the `super-stt:realtime/ws-server` export (see [wasm.md — Realtime](./wasm.md#realtime-websocket)). When `true`, the daemon wires those interfaces into the WASM component for every session on a realtime model. **wasm-only** — a `subprocess` backend declaring `websocket = true` is rejected at discovery. Default `false`. |

## `[[models]]`

One entry per model the backend provides. Each model is identified on the
wire by `(name, source)`, where `source` is the `[backend].source`
above.

```toml
[[models]]
name                   = "whisper-tiny"
multilingual           = true
primary_language       = "en"
supported_languages    = ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh"]  # abbreviated
supported_devices      = ["cpu", "gpu"]
estimated_vram_bytes   = 262144000
processing_interval_ms = 1000
```

| Field                    | Type            | Required | Notes                                                            |
|--------------------------|-----------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`                   | string          | yes      | Wire model name.                                                 |
| `multilingual`           | bool            | no       | Whether the model accepts more than one language. Default `true`. When `true`, `POST /v1/transcribe` accepts a `language` from `supported_languages`. |
| `primary_language`       | string          | yes      | Default language code (e.g. `en`); used when `language` is omitted. |
| `supported_languages`    | array of string | yes      | Language codes the model accepts; must include `primary_language`. When `multilingual` is `false`, it is exactly `[primary_language]`. |
| `supported_devices`      | array of string | yes      | Whether the model can use an accelerator at all — which accelerator an installed build actually targets is a property of the [asset](#assets), not the model. Non-empty, drawn from `["cpu", "gpu", "none"]`. `"cuda"` and `"metal"` are accepted input spellings for `"gpu"`; the daemon normalizes them and never emits them. `"none"` is the sentinel for remote/online models and must be the only entry when present. |
| `estimated_vram_bytes`   | integer         | no       | Conservative GPU memory estimate. Default `0`; use `0` for cloud models. |
| `processing_interval_ms` | integer         | no       | Suggested minimum interval between streaming passes, in ms.      |
| `realtime`               | bool            | no       | When `true`, the model is driven over the consumer-facing WebSocket endpoint (`GET /v1/transcribe/realtime`) rather than batch `POST /v1/transcribe`. Requires `[capabilities] websocket = true`. Default `false`. |
| `provider`               | string          | no       | Compatibility field. Not part of model identity and read by nothing in the daemon; it is echoed back verbatim as `provider` in [`POST /v1/load`](./contract.md#post-v1load) so a backend that still validates it keeps loading. |

> **Compatibility.** `provider` was part of model identity before it became
> `(name, source)`. Backends released against the earlier contract compare the
> `provider` in `POST /v1/load` against their own fixed value and answer
> `400 invalid_model` on a mismatch, so a manifest declaring `provider` still

`multilingual`, `primary_language`, and `supported_languages` together
describe language capability. When `multilingual` is `true`,
`POST /v1/transcribe` may carry a `language`, which must be one of
`supported_languages`; when omitted, `primary_language` is used. When
`multilingual` is `false`, the model transcribes only `primary_language`.

`supported_devices` declares whether the model can use an accelerator at all.
It says nothing about *which* accelerator — CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan — since one
asset can serve several models and one of them may have no GPU path; that
detail lives on the asset that ends up installed (see
[`[[assets.subprocess]]`](#assets)) and is reported per-backend as
`installed_accel` (see [`GET /backends`](../endpoints/v1/backends.md)). The
settings app uses `supported_devices` to present the device choice at load
time. `"none"` marks a remote/online model with no local compute; mixing
`"none"` with any local device (`"cpu"` / `"gpu"`) is a contradiction and the
manifest is rejected.

### `[[models.files]]`

The files a model needs, and where to place them. `files` is an array in which
each entry describes **one file**: a download URL and the path to write it to.
The daemon fetches every file before calling `POST /v1/load`. Files are fetched
the same way regardless of host — no source is given special treatment. Cloud
models declare no files.

Written compactly as an inline-table array on the model:

```toml
files = [
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny/resolve/main/config.json",
      destination = "models/whisper-tiny/config.json" },
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny/resolve/main/model.safetensors",
      destination = "models/whisper-tiny/model.safetensors", sha256 = "9f86d0…" },
]
```

The block form is identical TOML and may be used instead:

```toml
[[models.files]]
url         = "https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny/resolve/main/config.json"
destination = "models/whisper-tiny/config.json"
```

| Field         | Type   | Required | Notes                                                                |
|---------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `url`         | string | yes      | Full download URL for the file. Any host.                            |
| `destination` | string | yes      | Relative file path (including filename) under the backend directory. |
| `sha256`      | string | no       | Expected SHA-256, hex-encoded; verified after download.              |

`destination` must be a relative path that stays inside the backend directory:
absolute paths, `..` traversal, and backslashes are rejected.

## Example: local backend (subprocess)

A Whisper backend providing two models, loaded from Hugging Face. Whisper
models ship `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, and a single
`model.safetensors`.

```toml
[backend]
source      = "github.com/super-stt/whisper"
name        = "Whisper (local)"
version     = "0.1.0"
kind        = "subprocess"
entrypoint  = "whisper-backend"
contract    = "v1"
license     = "Apache-2.0"
description = "Local Whisper speech-to-text."

[network]
allowed_hosts = []

[[models]]
name                   = "whisper-tiny"
multilingual           = true
primary_language       = "en"
supported_languages    = ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh"]  # abbreviated
supported_devices      = ["cpu", "gpu"]
estimated_vram_bytes   = 262144000
processing_interval_ms = 1000
files = [
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny/resolve/main/config.json",
      destination = "models/whisper-tiny/config.json" },
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny/resolve/main/tokenizer.json",
      destination = "models/whisper-tiny/tokenizer.json" },
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-tiny/resolve/main/model.safetensors",
      destination = "models/whisper-tiny/model.safetensors" },
]

[[models]]
name                   = "voxtral-mini"
multilingual           = true
primary_language       = "en"
supported_languages    = ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh"]  # abbreviated
supported_devices      = ["gpu"]
estimated_vram_bytes   = 8589934592
processing_interval_ms = 2000

# Voxtral ships tekken.json instead of tokenizer.json, and multi-shard
# weights.
files = [
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507/resolve/main/config.json",
      destination = "models/voxtral-mini/config.json" },
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507/resolve/main/tekken.json",
      destination = "models/voxtral-mini/tekken.json" },
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507/resolve/main/model-00001-of-00002.safetensors",
      destination = "models/voxtral-mini/model-00001-of-00002.safetensors" },
    { url = "https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-3B-2507/resolve/main/model-00002-of-00002.safetensors",
      destination = "models/voxtral-mini/model-00002-of-00002.safetensors" },
]
```

## Example: cloud backend (WASM)

An OpenAI backend. No model files; one egress host; one secret and one option.

```toml
[backend]
source      = "github.com/super-stt/openai"
name        = "OpenAI"
version     = "0.1.0"
kind        = "wasm"
entrypoint  = "openai.wasm"
contract    = "v1"
license     = "Apache-2.0"
description = "OpenAI cloud transcription API."

[network]
allowed_hosts = ["api.openai.com"]

[[secrets]]
name        = "openai_api_key"
label       = "OpenAI API key"
description = "Used to authenticate requests to api.openai.com."

# No `default`: it is forbidden on `base_url`. The component carries the
# stock endpoint and treats this option as an override.
[[options]]
name        = "base_url"
label       = "API base URL"
description = "Override the API base URL, e.g. for a gateway."
type        = "string"

[[models]]
name                = "whisper-1"
multilingual        = true
primary_language    = "en"
supported_languages = ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh"]  # abbreviated
supported_devices   = ["none"]

[[models]]
name                = "gpt-4o-transcribe"
multilingual        = true
primary_language    = "en"
supported_languages = ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh"]  # abbreviated
supported_devices   = ["none"]
```

## Validation

- String-valued enums (`kind`, file `source`, option `type`) are
  **snake_case**; unknown values are rejected and a backend whose
  configuration fails validation is skipped during discovery rather than
  loaded with defaults.
- Whether a model is online/remote is decided solely by `supported_devices`
  (the `none` sentinel).
- Secret and option `name`s are **snake_case** identifiers matching
  `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` (e.g. `openai_api_key`, `base_url`), unique within their
  table. The `name` is the wire identifier the backend reads the value by;
  `label` is the human-readable text shown beside the input in the settings
  UI. Secret values are stored encrypted; option values are stored as
  plaintext.
- `[backend].id`, when present, must match the [`id` format](#id-format)
  above; a manifest declaring a malformed `id` fails to parse, and the
  backend is skipped during discovery. It must also be unique across
  installed backends, since it names the install directory: the registry
  indexer refuses to publish an index in which two entries declare the same
  `id`, and an install whose target directory already holds a backend
  declaring a different `[backend].source` is refused rather than allowed to
  replace it.
- `[backend].source` must be unique across installed backends. When two
  installed directories declare the same `source`, the daemon serves exactly
  one of them and removes the other. The survivor is chosen in this order:
  highest `[backend].version`; then the directory named after the backend's
  own `[backend].id`, its canonical location; then the lexicographically
  first directory name, so the outcome is stable across scans. Version leads
  because a backend updated in place is the newer install whatever its
  directory happens to be called. Before the other directory is removed,
  every model file it holds that the survivor's manifest still declares at
  the same `destination` *and* the same `url` is moved across, so resolving a
  duplicate never costs a re-download. A directory whose `backend.toml` does
  not parse is never a candidate — neither to survive nor to be removed:
  without a readable `source` there is no evidence it is the same backend.
- `[backend].description` is required: a one-line, human-readable summary
  shown in the registry/Browse listing. A manifest that omits it fails to
  parse, and the backend is skipped during discovery.
- `[backend].license` is required for registry publication: a current
  OSI-approved or FSF Free/Libre SPDX identifier, or the literal `other`. The
  indexer rejects a release whose manifest omits the field or declares an
  unrecognized value. Locally installed backends may omit it.
- Each `[[assets.subprocess]]` variant declares exactly one of `file` or
  `parts`; `parts`, when used, must be non-empty and its filenames are
  concatenated in the listed order. The indexer rejects any single release
  asset — a `file` or an individual part — larger than 2 GiB (the GitHub
  release-asset limit).
- A `subprocess` backend with a non-empty `allowed_hosts` is rejected — the
  transport provides no network.
- `primary_language` must appear in `supported_languages`. When
  `multilingual` is `false`, `supported_languages` must be exactly
  `[primary_language]`.
- `supported_devices` is required and non-empty for every model. Each entry
  must be one of `cpu`, `gpu`, `none` — `cuda` and `metal` are accepted input
  spellings normalized to `gpu` — and the sentinel `none` (remote / online
  model) must be the only entry when present. A backend whose
  manifest violates any of these is skipped during discovery.
- A `subprocess` backend that declares `[capabilities] websocket = true` is
  rejected at discovery — realtime WebSocket support is wasm-only.
- Any model entry with `realtime = true` in a backend whose
  `[capabilities] websocket` is `false` or absent is rejected at discovery.
