# `/update`

Read the daemon's self-update status: its own version, the latest
published release, and whether an update is available. This is a
read-only snapshot of the last completed check — it does not trigger
a new one. To force an immediate check, use
[`POST /update/check`](./update/check.md).

Candidate selection: the daemon considers the highest semver among
published releases; prereleases are included iff
`beta_optin_effective`; draft releases and tags that don't parse as
semver are always ignored.

## Auth

- **Required scope:** `settings`.
- `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>` is required.
- Tokens without the `settings` scope get `403 scope_denied`.

## `GET /update`

**Request:**

```http
GET /update HTTP/1.1
Host: stt.local
Authorization: Bearer stt_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

| Field                   | Type    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `current_version`        | string  | The daemon's own workspace version (no `v` prefix).                                                                                                                               |
| `latest_version`         | string? | The candidate release's tag, verbatim (with `v` prefix); `null` before the first completed check.                                                                                 |
| `update_available`       | bool    | Strict semver "candidate > current"; prerelease-aware; never `true` for downgrades or unparsable tags.                                                                            |
| `checked_at`              | string? | RFC 3339 UTC of the last completed check attempt; `null` before the first.                                                                                                         |
| `last_check_error`       | string? | Human-readable failure of the last attempt, `null` on success. A failed check keeps the previous successful result's `latest_version`/`installer_asset` only while `beta_optin_effective` is unchanged from that success; if the effective opt-in changed since (e.g. the `update_beta_optin` setting flipped), the stale candidate is cleared instead of reported alongside the new opt-in. |
| `beta_optin_effective`   | bool    | Resolved from the [`update_beta_optin`](./update_beta_optin.md) setting (`auto` → `true` iff `current_version` is a prerelease). Before the first completed check it reports the setting as currently configured; from the first completed check onward it reports the channel the candidate fields were resolved under, so the two are always consistent. |
| `installer_asset`        | object? | The `super-stt-install-<target-triple>` asset of the candidate release for this host's architecture; `null` when there is no update, the release lacks the asset, the arch is unsupported, or the release's `SHA256SUMS` asset is unavailable or doesn't list the binary. Clients download this URL to apply the update. |

`installer_asset` fields:

| Field    | Type   | Notes                                                                                     |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`   | string | Asset file name.                                                                            |
| `url`    | string | Download URL for the asset.                                                                 |
| `size`   | u64    | Asset size in bytes.                                                                         |
| `sha256` | string | Hex SHA-256 of the binary at `url`, from the release's `SHA256SUMS` asset. Always present when `installer_asset` is non-null. Clients MUST verify the downloaded bytes against this before executing the binary. |

**Errors:**

| HTTP | `message`         | Meaning                                  |
