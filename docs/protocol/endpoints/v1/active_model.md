# `/active_model`

Read and switch the active STT model. Cancellation of an in-flight
switch lives at [`POST /active_model/cancel`](./active_model/cancel.md);
the catalog of available models lives at [`GET /models`](./models.md).

The active model is identified by a `(name, source)`
pair:

- **`name`** — `whisper-1`, `voxtral-mini`, …
- **`source`** — the repo id of the backend that serves the model
  (e.g. `github.com/super-stt/openai`), as returned by
  [`GET /models`](./models.md). Empty/omitted resolves to the
  [active backend](./active_backend.md); with no active backend the call fails
  with `400 invalid_backend`.

A model switch is a switch *within* a backend: `source` never has to be guessed.
Two backends may serve the same `name`, so resolving an omitted `source` by
scanning for whichever backend happens to serve it would pick an engine the
caller did not ask for — and that choice is persisted as the active backend.
Select the backend first with
[`POST /active_backend`](./active_backend.md), or name `source` explicitly.

Switching the model also sets the [active backend](./active_backend.md) to the
model's `source`. If the model then fails to load (e.g. a missing secret), the
backend stays selected but **no model is loaded** — the daemon does not silently
restore a previously-loaded model. Clear the selection with
[`DELETE /active_backend`](./active_backend.md).

## Auth

- **Required scope:** `settings`.
- `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>` is required.
- Tokens without the `settings` scope get `403 scope_denied`.

## `POST /active_model`

Start switching the active model. The call returns `202 Accepted`
immediately; the actual switch runs asynchronously. Progress is
visible via:

- [`GET /active_model`](#get-active_model) — polling.
- [`GET /events?topics=daemon_status_changed,download_progress`](./events.md)
  — push-based via SSE (recommended).

**Request:**

```http
POST /active_model HTTP/1.1
Host: stt.local
Authorization: Bearer stt_…64hex…
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model":    "whisper-1",
  "source":   "github.com/super-stt/openai"
}
```

| Field      | Type    | Required | Notes                                                                  |
|------------|---------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model`    | string  | yes      | One of the names returned by [`GET /models`](./models.md)              |
| `source`   | string  | no       | Repo id of the serving backend. Empty/omitted resolves to the [active backend](./active_backend.md). |

**Response (202):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status":  "success",
  "message": "Model switch started"
}
```

The actual identity / load state of the new model becomes visible
through [`GET /active_model`](#get-active_model) once the switch
completes; the most reliable client UX is to subscribe to the SSE
topics above.

**Errors:**

## `GET /active_model`

Returns the currently-active model plus the state of any in-flight
switch, in a single payload so a settings UI can render the entire
"Model" section from one request.

**Request:**

```http
GET /active_model HTTP/1.1
Host: stt.local
Authorization: Bearer stt_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):**

```jsonc

  "status": "success",

`current.provider` is always an empty string. It is emitted so clients that
require the key can still parse the response, and carries no information —
identify a model by `(name, source)` instead. It will be removed.

**Phase values** (`switch.phase`):

| Value          | Meaning                                                                              |

| `downloading`  | Pulling model files; `download` sub-object is populated.                              |
| `completed`    | Downloads finished; the model is being loaded onto the chosen device.                 |
| `cancelled`    | [`POST /active_model/cancel`](./active_model/cancel.md) interrupted the download.    |
| `error`        | Download failed (network, disk, hash mismatch, …).                                    |

`switch` is `null` when no download is in flight.

**Errors:**

## `DELETE /active_model`

Unload the currently loaded model. The active backend stays selected — the
user can immediately pick another of its models with `POST /active_model`.
To return the daemon to fully idle, use [`DELETE /active_backend`](./active_backend.md)
instead. No-op when nothing is loaded; rejected during an active recording or
real-time transcription session.

**Request:**

```http
DELETE /active_model HTTP/1.1
Host: stt.local
Authorization: Bearer stt_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{ "status": "success", "message": "Unloaded whisper-1" }
```

**Errors:**

| HTTP | `message`         | Meaning                                                       |
