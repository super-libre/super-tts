# `/pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/language`

Read and set a model's **language override** — the language it speaks in — and
read the daemon's resolved effective language. The override is one of the
model's `supported_languages`, the reserved `auto`, or absent (Automatic —
inherits the global [`/settings/language`](../settings/language.md), else the
model's `primary_language`). It is stored per `(source, model)` and survives
model switches. Only multilingual models accept an override.

Addressed through the stage that runs the model, exactly like its
[device](./device.md), and for the same reason: both are per-model preferences,
and the stage is what resolves a bare model name against the backend filling
it. Two preferences of the same shape addressed two different ways is something
a client author has to memorise rather than infer.

The symmetry goes one level further. What is *set* and what may *be set* are
separate endpoints, as they are for the device:

| | is set | may be set |
|---|---|---|
| device   | [`/device`](./device.md#get-pipelinestagemodelmodeldevice) | [`/device/list`](./device.md#get-pipelinestagemodelmodeldevicelist) |
| language | `/language`                                                | [`/language/list`](#get-pipelinestagemodelmodellanguagelist)        |

`{model}` is the model name as
[`GET /pipeline/{stage}/model/list`](./model-list.md) spells it; names contain
only alphanumerics and hyphens, so the segment is used as-is (no encoding
needed).

**This is not the voice.** A model's language decides how text is pronounced —
which phonemizer and which lexicon — while its `voice` decides who says it.
They interact (a voice trained on one language may sound wrong reading
another), but they are chosen separately: the voice is
[`/voice`](./voice.md), a stored preference of exactly this shape, and it is
*also* a per-utterance field on [`POST /speak`](../speak.md), where this one is
not.

## Auth

- **Required scope:** `settings`.
- `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>` is required on every request.
- A token without the `settings` scope gets `403 scope_denied`.

## `GET /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/language`

Returns the daemon's full resolution for the named model — not just the stored
value, because a UI showing "Automatic" still has to show *what* automatic
resolved to.

**Request:**

```http
GET /pipeline/1/model/kokoro-82m/language HTTP/1.1
Host: tts.local
Authorization: Bearer tts_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):**

```jsonc
{
  "status": "success",
  "language": {
    "multilingual": true,
    "source":    "override",      // "override" | "global" | "default"
    "effective": "es-419",        // the value sent to the backend; null = omitted (model primary)
    "override":  "es-419",        // the stored per-model value, or null
    "primary":   "en"             // the model's primary_language (the fallback)
  }
}
```

| Field          | Type    | Notes                                                                |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `multilingual` | bool    | Whether the model accepts a language tag at all.                     |
| `source`       | string  | Where `effective` came from: `override` (set here), `global` (the [`/settings/language`](../settings/language.md) value), or `default` (the model's own `primary_language`). |
| `effective`    | string? | The tag the daemon sends the backend on each synthesis. `null` means the field is omitted and the model uses its primary. |
| `override`     | string? | The stored per-model value, or `null` for Automatic.                 |
| `primary`      | string  | The model's `primary_language` — the fallback when nothing else applies. |

For a non-multilingual model: `"multilingual": false`, `"effective": null`,
`"override": null`, `"primary": "en"`, `"source": "default"`.

The tags this model accepts are **not** here — they are
[`GET .../language/list`](#get-pipelinestagemodelmodellanguagelist), the way a
model's device list is not part of its device. This endpoint answers what is
set; that one answers what may be set, and only one of them changes when the
user picks a language.

## `GET /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/language/list`

What `POST` will accept for this model: the tags it serves, plus the reserved
`auto`.

**Request:**

```http
GET /pipeline/1/model/kokoro-82m/language/list HTTP/1.1
Host: tts.local
Authorization: Bearer tts_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "available_languages": ["auto", "en", "es-419", "es-ES", "fr", "ja", "zh"]
}
```

Fill a language picker from this rather than from a general BCP-47 list: a tag
the model does not serve is refused, and offering one is an error the user only
discovers by choosing it — after which the utterance they wanted comes out in
the wrong language or not at all.

**Empty for a monolingual model**, which has nothing to choose however many
tags its manifest lists — the same shape
[`/device/list`](./device.md#get-pipelinestagemodelmodeldevicelist) answers
with for a model that runs remotely. A client hides the control on an empty
list rather than special-casing a status.

## `POST /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/language`

Pin the model to one language, overriding the global setting.

**Request:**

```http
POST /pipeline/1/model/kokoro-82m/language HTTP/1.1
Host: tts.local
Authorization: Bearer tts_…64hex…
Content-Type: application/json

{ "language": "es-419" }
```

| Field      | Type   | Required | Notes                                                              |
|------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `language` | string | yes      | One of the tags [`/language/list`](#get-pipelinestagemodelmodellanguagelist) offers. To clear, `DELETE`. |

**Response (200):** the resolution block (as `GET`), with `source` now
`override`.

The new value applies to the next utterance; one already being spoken finishes
in the language it started in.

## `DELETE /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/language`

Clear the override (back to Automatic).

**Request:**

```http
DELETE /pipeline/1/model/kokoro-82m/language HTTP/1.1
Host: tts.local
Authorization: Bearer tts_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):** the resolution block (as `GET`), with `source` now `global`
or `default`.
