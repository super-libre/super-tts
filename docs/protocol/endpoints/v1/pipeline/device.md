# `/pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/device`

Which accelerator a model runs on, and what this install can offer it.

The preference belongs to the **model**, not to the stage and not to the
daemon: a 82M-parameter preset-voice model runs fine on the CPU while the
cloning model beside it needs the GPU, and a user who chose one for each should
not have their choice overwritten by whichever they configured last. It is
remembered per `(source, model)`, and addressed through the
[stage](./stage.md) that runs it, because that is what resolves a bare model
name to a backend.

> **Replaces `/active_device`,** which set one device for the whole daemon.
> A daemon upgraded from it keeps loading models where it always did: a model
> with no device of its own falls back to the old global value in
> `daemon.toml`, and takes its own the first time one is set here.

Two list endpoints sit beside it: the per-model list, which is the narrow and
accurate answer once a model is chosen, and
[`/pipeline/{stage}/device/list`](#get-pipelinestagedevicelist), the
backend-wide union for a client filling a picker before one is. The
[auth](../pipeline.md#auth) is the family's.

> [`GET /gpu_info`](../gpu_info.md) reports the host's hardware without regard
> to what a model supports — it is the memory figure a large model's
> `estimated_vram_bytes` is weighed against, not the source of a device
> picker. Fill a picker from `available_devices` here instead.

## `GET /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/device`

The device `model` runs on. `model` is resolved against the backend selected
for this stage — the same resolution an omitted `source` gets on
[`POST /pipeline/{stage}/model`](./model.md#post-pipelinestagemodel) — so the
stage must have a backend selected, or this answers `400 invalid_backend`.

| `resolved_accel`    | string?  | What that preference resolved to: `"cuda"`, `"rocm"`, `"metal"`, `"vulkan"` or `"cpu"` while the model is loaded in this stage — always what actually loaded, so a `"gpu"` choice that fell back reads `"cpu"` here.

| `available_devices` | string[] | The devices this install can offer the model on this host: the model's `supported_devices`, narrowed to the accelerators its installed asset actually provides (`installed_accel` on [`GET /backend/list`](../backends.md)) and to what the host has. A CUDA-only backend on a host without an NVIDIA GPU installed its CPU asset, and is not offered a GPU here. Empty for an online model. |

## `POST /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/device`

Run `model` on `device`. For the model loaded in this stage this is a reload
onto the new device; for any other it only records the choice, which the
model's next load picks up. Either way the choice is the model's own from then
on: it is remembered per `(source, model)`, so two models on one backend can
live on different devices.

**Request:**

```http

Authorization: Bearer tts_…64hex…

| `device` | string | yes      | `"cpu"` or `"gpu"`. `"cuda"` and `"metal"` are accepted input spellings, normalized to `"gpu"`. Any other value is rejected. |

**Response (200):** the same body `GET` answers with, reflecting the new state.
`message` says which of the three things happened: recorded for the next load,
reloaded, or already on that device.

The reload, when there is one, completes before the response, and publishes
`switching_device`, `loading_model_for_device` and then `ready` — carrying the
resolved `actual_device` — on [`/events`](../events.md). The stage unloads
before it loads, because a backend cannot be instantiated twice for the same
model: the running instance holds the name its replacement needs. An utterance
therefore cannot be in flight across the swap, which is why
`409 speech_in_progress` guards it.

If the reload fails, the model is put back on the device it had and its setting
is left as it was, and the call fails with the reason — the user's choice is
not recorded against a load that did not happen. Should putting it back fail
too, the stage is left with nothing loaded and publishes a `ready` saying so.

Asking for the device a loaded model is already on reloads nothing — a `gpu`
preference already resolved to `cuda` is the same choice spelled twice — but a
`gpu` preference that fell back to the CPU **is** retried, which is what
tracking the preference and the resolved accelerator separately is for: a user
who plugged in a GPU, or freed the VRAM a first attempt lacked, gets the retry
they were asking for.

**Errors:** those of `GET` above, plus:

| HTTP | `error_code`         | Meaning                                                                    |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400  | `invalid_device`     | `device` is not `"cpu"`, `"gpu"` or an accepted alias; or the model's manifest does not declare it (a CPU-only model cannot be sent to the GPU); or the model is online and has no local device. Nothing is recorded. |
| 409  | `speech_in_progress` | A reload is needed and an utterance or streaming session is in flight       |
| 500  | *(uncoded)*          | The reload failed. The `message` names the failure and the device the model was put back on; the setting is unchanged. |

Requesting `"gpu"` for a model whose install or host cannot provide one is
**not** an error — only the manifest is consulted — and the load falls back to
the CPU, surfaced as `resolved_accel: "cpu"` and the `ready` event's
`actual_device`. Synthesis on the CPU is slower but correct, so failing the
call would cost the user speech to save them a latency surprise. A client that
wants to offer only what will work narrows its picker to `available_devices`.

## `GET /pipeline/{stage}/model/{model}/device/list`

The devices this install can offer `model` on this host — the
`available_devices` of the model's [device](#get-pipelinestagemodelmodeldevice),
on its own, for a client that only wants to fill a picker. `model` resolves the
same way, and the same errors apply.

**Request:**

```http
GET /pipeline/1/model/kokoro-82m/device/list HTTP/1.1
Host: tts.local
Authorization: Bearer tts_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status":            "success",
  "available_devices": ["cpu", "gpu"]
}
```

Empty for an online model, and for a local model this install cannot run on any
device (a GPU-only model whose installed asset is CPU-only). A client hides the
device control on an empty list rather than special-casing a status.

## `GET /pipeline/{stage}/device/list`

The devices the backend selected for this stage can be run on here: the union
of the list above over the models it serves **for this stage's role**. This is
the answer for a card that has a backend but no model yet — showing a device
control that will be wrong once a model is picked is worse than showing the
union and narrowing it. Always in `cpu`, `gpu` order.

**Request:**

```http
GET /pipeline/1/device/list HTTP/1.1
Host: tts.local
Authorization: Bearer tts_…64hex…
```

**Response (200):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status":            "success",
  "available_devices": ["cpu", "gpu"]
}
```

**Errors:** `404 unknown_stage`; `400 invalid_backend` when no backend is
selected for the stage; plus the auth errors above.
