# `POST /auth/request`

Mint a fresh session token, normally by triggering the consent
popup. This is the only endpoint a new client can call before it
has a token.

See [auth.md](../../auth.md) for the broader handshake design and
the full list of `auth_denied` reasons.

## Auth

- **Required scope:** none. This is the bootstrap endpoint.
- `Authorization` header is ignored if present.

## `POST /auth/request`

Spawn the consent popup. The user is shown the requesting binary's
identity, the scopes being requested, and an Allow / Deny choice.
The call blocks until the user chooses, dismisses, or the popup
times out (60 s default).

First-party client binaries are approved automatically, without a
popup — see [First-party clients](../../../auth.md#first-party-clients)
in auth.md.

**Response (403, on failure):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status":  "error",
  "message": "auth_denied",
  "data":    { "reason": "user_denied" }
}
```

| `data.reason`         | Meaning                                                                                  | Client should                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user_denied`         | User clicked Deny in the popup.                                                          | Do **not** auto-retry. Offer an explicit Retry button.                 |
| `user_denied_cached`  | This identity was already denied; popup wasn't shown. Sticky until the daemon restarts.  | Same — surface a hint that restarting the daemon clears the deny.       |
| `user_dismissed`      | User closed the popup without choosing, or it timed out.                                 | Recoverable. Re-prompt when the user takes an action that requires it. |
| `popup_failed`        | Consent popup couldn't be shown (no display server, no Wayland session, etc.).           | Fall back to read-only mode if possible.                               |
| `invalid_scope`       | `scopes` was empty, missing, or contained a name that isn't a known scope.               | Fix the request body.                                                  |
| `throttled`           | Too many `/auth/request` calls from this peer in a short window.                         | Back off and retry later.                                              |
| `uid_mismatch`        | Peer UID doesn't match the daemon's effective UID. The daemon only serves its own user; cross-user requests under a shared group are rejected before the popup. | Run as the same user as the daemon (typically the desktop user).         |

The token returned by this endpoint should be persisted in a
**secure** store (the platform keyring, libsecret/KWallet, the OS
credential manager) — plaintext on disk would let any other process
running as the same user impersonate the app.
