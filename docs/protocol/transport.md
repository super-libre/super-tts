# Transport & Connection Lifecycle

This document describes how a client talks to the super-stt daemon at
the wire level: where the daemon listens, what HTTP shape every request
and response take, and how broadcast events are delivered over Server-
Sent Events.

It is the protocol-wide companion to:

- [auth.md](./auth.md) — authentication handshake and the full scope catalog
- the per-scope docs under [`scopes/`](./scopes/) — what each scope unlocks
- [`/events`](./endpoints/v1/events.md) — the SSE topic reference

The wire shape is HTTP/1.1 over a Unix domain socket. A future config
flag will let the daemon bind a TCP listener with the same HTTP API
(see "Forward compatibility with TCP" below); the endpoints,
headers, JSON bodies, and SSE framing all stay the same.

## Where the daemon listens

| Transport      | Address                                            | When                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Unix socket    | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/stt/super-stt-http.sock`         | Always (default)                    |
| TCP            | `127.0.0.1:<configurable port>`                    | Optional, opt-in via daemon config  |

Native Linux clients should use the Unix socket. The daemon authenticates
peers there via `SO_PEERCRED` + `/proc/<pid>/exe`, which is what the
consent design depends on. The TCP bind is intended for browser apps
where `SO_PEERCRED` isn't available — see
[auth.md](./auth.md#tcp-bound-clients).

The socket path can be overridden via the `SUPER_STT_HTTP_SOCKET`
environment variable (tests use this to bind a unique socket per run).
The daemon and every in-tree client resolve the path through the same
helper, so the override applies to both ends — set it in a shared
environment and the daemon listener and its clients stay in agreement.

The daemon serves the same routes on both transports.

## Wire shape: HTTP/1.1 + JSON

Every interaction except event streaming is one HTTP request and one
HTTP response. Standard HTTP semantics:

```http
POST /transcribe HTTP/1.1
Host: stt.local
Authorization: Bearer stt_…64hex…
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 178

{
  "audio_data":  null,
  "sample_rate": null,
  "language":    "en",
  "wait":        true,
  "stream_realtime": true,
  "stop_mode":   "manual_only"
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 60

{
  "status": "success",
  "transcription": "hello world"
}
```

Anything an HTTP/1.1 client library does — connection reuse,
pipelining, chunked transfer encoding — is supported. Whether you
open one connection per request or hold a keep-alive open is up to
you; authentication is per-request via the `Authorization` header.

The `Host` header is required by HTTP/1.1 but its value is ignored.
Use `stt.local`, `localhost`, or anything else.

## Authentication header

Every request after the initial `POST /auth/request` carries:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <session_token>
```

The session token is a 32-byte random value, hex-encoded, returned by
[`/auth/request`](./auth.md). It's validated on every request. On
failure you'll see:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "invalid_session",
  "data": { "reason": "expired" }
}
```

The reason is one of `unknown`, `expired`, or `exe_changed`. The client
must re-issue `POST /auth/request` to obtain a fresh token.

## Request and response shapes

| Endpoint kind | HTTP                          | Body                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Read          | `GET /name`                   | none                              |
| Mutate        | `POST /name`                  | JSON arguments (or empty)         |
| Action        | `POST /name`                  | JSON arguments                    |
| Event stream  | `GET /events?topics=...`      | none, returns SSE                 |

Responses are always JSON with a top-level `status` field that is
`"success"` or `"error"`. The HTTP status code mirrors the JSON status:
2xx for success, 4xx for client errors (auth, validation, scope
denial), 5xx for server-side failures.

| HTTP status | When                                                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 OK      | Successful read or mutation                                 |
| 202 Accepted| Successful mutation that runs asynchronously (e.g. `POST /active_model`) |
| 400 Bad Request | Request validation failed (missing fields, bad enum)    |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing or invalid `Authorization` header              |
| 403 Forbidden | Token valid but scope insufficient (`scope_denied`)       |
| 404 Not Found | Unknown endpoint                                          |
| 409 Conflict | Mutation rejected because of state (e.g. switch already in flight) |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate-limit hit                                    |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Daemon-side bug; details in logs              |

## Event streams: Server-Sent Events

Subscriptions use `GET /events?topics=...`. The daemon keeps the
connection open and writes one SSE frame per published event until the
client disconnects or the daemon shuts down.

```http
GET /events?topics=recording_state,frequency_bands,daemon_status_changed,download_progress HTTP/1.1
Host: stt.local
Authorization: Bearer stt_…
Accept: text/event-stream
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-store

event: subscribed
data: {"client_id":"sub_…","subscribed_to":["recording_state","frequency_bands","daemon_status_changed","download_progress"]}

event: recording_state
data: {"is_recording":true}

event: daemon_status_changed
data: {"status":"loading_model","new_model":"whisper-base","timestamp":"2026-05-22T12:34:56Z"}

event: download_progress
data: {"model_name":"whisper-base","current_file":"model.safetensors","file_index":1,"total_files":3,"bytes_downloaded":12345,"total_bytes":45678,"percentage":27.0,"status":"downloading","eta_seconds":14,"timestamp":"2026-05-22T12:34:57Z"}

event: daemon_status_changed
data: {"status":"ready","model_loaded":true,"model_name":"whisper-base","timestamp":"2026-05-22T12:35:14Z"}
```

Conventions:

- The first frame is always `event: subscribed` with the assigned
  subscriber `client_id` and the resolved topic list. Topics the
  client requested but isn't allowed to see (e.g. a token without
  `daemon_status` asking for `daemon_status_changed`) cause a
  `403 scope_denied` before the stream opens; partial subscriptions
  aren't supported.
- Each subsequent frame's `event:` field is the topic name. The
  `data:` field is one JSON line carrying the topic-specific payload
  directly (no wrapper envelope). For example, `recording_state` is
  `{"is_recording":true}`; `daemon_status_changed` is
  `{"status":"…", …, "timestamp":"…"}`. See
  [`/events`](./endpoints/v1/events.md) for per-topic shapes and the
  scope each topic requires.
- Multi-line `data:` is permitted by SSE; events arrive as a single
  line per event.
- An SSE comment (line starting with `:`) arrives every 30 seconds
  as a keep-alive. Clients should ignore them; their job is to stop
  HTTP intermediaries from timing the connection out and to give
  clients a stable cadence to detect a wedged stream (if no comment
  or event arrives for a minute, the connection is dead — close it
  and reconnect).

The `topics` query parameter is comma-separated. Repeating it
(`?topics=a&topics=b`) is also accepted and merges to the same set.

### Audio fan-out is on the same stream

The audio fan-out — recording state, frequency bands, partial /
final STT — is just additional topics on the same SSE stream. There
is no separate UDP socket. Raw PCM is not exposed; the daemon
computes the frequency bands and broadcasts only those. See
[`/events`](./endpoints/v1/events.md) for the audio-specific topic
payloads.

For binary efficiency, frequency-band payloads use base64 inside the
JSON `data` field (`bands_b64`). The encoding overhead (~33 %) is
negligible on a local socket.

### Slow consumers

A subscriber that doesn't drain fast enough has its oldest queued
events dropped — the connection itself isn't closed, and the next
live event arrives normally. Clients that want to verify they
didn't miss critical state can issue a fresh `GET` on the relevant
resource (e.g. `GET /active_model`) — those snapshots are
authoritative.

### Closing the stream

The client closes the stream by closing the underlying HTTP
connection. There is no `unsubscribe` request — the connection *is*
the subscription. The stream may also end on the server side, in
which case the last frame the client receives identifies why:

- `event: shutdown` / `data: {}` — the daemon is going away.
- `event: revoked` / `data: { "reason": "..." }` — the session is no
  longer accepted. Reasons include `expired`, `exe_changed` (the
  client's binary identity changed, see
  [auth.md](./auth.md#anti-replacement)), and any other
  revocation cause. The client must re-issue `/auth/request` before
  reopening the stream.

## Error responses

Every error returns a JSON body with the same shape:

```jsonc
{
  "status":     "error",
  "error_code": "recording_in_progress",
  "message":    "Cannot change the backend during active recording.",
  "data":       { "reason": "<machine-readable reason>", ... }
}
```

`error_code` is a stable, machine-readable `snake_case` identifier — the
field clients should switch on. It is present on every error the daemon
originates. `message` is a human-readable, single-line explanation suitable
for display; it is sanitized so secrets can't leak into the response body,
and its exact wording is **not** part of the contract (do not match on it).
The optional `data` carries additional structured detail.

The HTTP status is derived from `error_code` (e.g. a state-conflict code →
`409`, a bad-input code → `400`); an error the daemon cannot classify carries
no `error_code` and surfaces as `500`.

> **Compatibility.** `error_code` was introduced after `message`. Earlier
> clients switched on `message`, and the auth identifiers (`invalid_session`,
> `scope_denied`) still appear there verbatim for that reason. New clients
> should switch on `error_code`.

## Forward compatibility with TCP

When the daemon's TCP listener is enabled, the same HTTP API is served
on `127.0.0.1:<port>`. Three things change:

1. **Auth identity.** `SO_PEERCRED` doesn't apply, so the consent
   popup prompts for a *web origin* (the `Origin` request header)
   rather than an exe path. Tokens issued under TCP are keyed by
   `(app_name, web_origin)` instead of `(app_name, exe_path)`. The
   wire shape (Authorization header, JSON bodies) is identical.

2. **CORS / Private Network Access headers** are present on TCP
   responses. Browsers enforce them; raw TCP clients ignore them.
   These headers are emitted on the Unix socket too, where they're
   harmlessly ignored.

3. **TLS.** Chrome's Private Network Access spec wants HTTPS for
   public-site → localhost requests. The daemon presents a self-signed
   cert for `localhost` when TCP-bound; the user accepts it once.

Native Linux clients on the Unix socket get peer-credential-verified
identity. Browser clients on TCP get origin-verified identity. Both
hit the same endpoints.

## Authoring a non-Rust client

The minimal recipe for a fresh client of any scope:

1. Use any HTTP client your language has. Examples:
   ```bash
   curl --unix-socket "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/stt/super-stt-http.sock" \
        -X POST http://stt.local/auth/request \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"app_name":"My App","scopes":["transcribe","status"],"version":"0.1"}'
   ```
   ```python
   import requests_unixsocket
   s = requests_unixsocket.Session()
   r = s.post("http+unix://%2Frun%2Fuser%2F1000%2Fstt%2Fsuper-stt-http.sock/auth/request",
              json={"app_name": "My App", "scopes": ["transcribe", "status"], "version": "0.1"})
   token = r.json()["session_token"]
   ```
   ```javascript
   // Node
   const http = require('http');
   const req = http.request({
     socketPath: '/run/user/1000/stt/super-stt-http.sock',
     method: 'POST',
     path: '/auth/request',
     headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
   }, ...);
   ```

2. Persist the returned `session_token` in your platform's keyring.

3. For commands, send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request:
   ```bash
   curl --unix-socket "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/stt/super-stt-http.sock" \
        -X POST http://stt.local/transcribe \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $STT_TOKEN" \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"data":{"wait":true,"stream_realtime":true}}'
   ```

4. For event streams, use any HTTP client that supports SSE (or just
   read line-by-line):
   ```bash
   curl --unix-socket "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/stt/super-stt-http.sock" \
        -N \
        "http://stt.local/events?topics=recording_state,daemon_status_changed,download_progress" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $STT_TOKEN"
   ```

5. On any 401 with `message: "invalid_session"`, run the auth flow
   again and retry the original request.
