//! Unified traits for STT backends presented to the daemon.
//!
//! Three layered surfaces:
//! - [`ModelInfo`] — static metadata (name, source, capabilities).
//! - [`ModelState`] — runtime state that can change after load (device).
//! - [`Transcribe`] — actual inference.
//!
//! `Transcribe` is a supertrait of `ModelState`, which is a supertrait of
//! `ModelInfo`, so a `Box<dyn Transcribe>` exposes all three. The concrete
//! implementors are the backend hosts ([`WasmBackend`](super::wasm) and
//! [`SubprocessBackend`](super::subprocess)); the daemon never sees model
//! internals.
