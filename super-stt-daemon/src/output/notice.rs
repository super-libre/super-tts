//! What a recording failure looks like to the user.
//!
//! A failure reaches the user through one of two channels, and they carry
//! different amounts of detail because they land in different places.
//!
//! A desktop notification has a summary and a body of its own, and its app name
//! and icon are supplied separately — so the summary names the failure and the
//! body gives the reason, including the reasons a backend authored, which is
//! where most of them come from. Backends are explicitly untrusted (audit 2
//! Tier 3 #8) and a notification server may render limited markup in the body,
//! so that text is flattened, escaped, and clamped by [`sanitize`] before it is
//! handed over, and labelled so a relayed failure is never read as one of the
//! daemon's own.
//!
//! Typing has nowhere to put a reason: the notice goes into whatever window the
//! user has focused, in among their own text. It stays one fixed, bracketed,
//! daemon-authored string per failure and never carries backend text.
