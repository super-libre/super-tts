//! The `GET /backends` installed-backend catalog response.
//!
//! A backend is an installed model provider discovered on disk. Each one
//! declares the models it serves, the secrets it needs (stored in the system
//! keyring), and the options it accepts (stored in the daemon config). The
//! daemon serializes this catalog from its discovered backends; the settings UI
//! deserializes it and renders one section per backend. Keeping the shape here,
//! shared by both sides, is what keeps the wire contract from drifting.
//!
//! `#[serde(default)]` on the non-identity fields lets an older daemon that
//! omits a newer field still deserialize (the value simply defaults).
